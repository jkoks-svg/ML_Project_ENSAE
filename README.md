# Causal Inference Project: Impact of Scholarships on Student Success

**Main Research Questions:**
1. Does receiving a scholarship reduce the likelihood of dropping out within 3 years?
2. Does receiving a scholarship increase the likelihood of graduating within 3 years?

We apply **Double Machine Learning (DML)** and **Random Forests** to estimate causal effects using observational data from the UCI dataset _"Predict students dropout and academic success"_.
