# Causal Inference Project: Impact of Scholarships on Student Success

**Main Research Questions:**
1. Does receiving a scholarship reduce the likelihood of dropping out within 3 years?
2. Does receiving a scholarship increase the likelihood of graduating within 3 years?

We apply Double Post-Lasso (DPL) and Double Machine Learning (DML) methods to estimate the causal effect of scholarships on student outcomes, using observational data from a Portuguese university (UCI dataset "Predict students dropout and academic success"). The analysis includes rigorous covariate selection, heterogeneous treatment effect analysis by subgroup, and robustness checks (alternative models and placebo tests) to validate the findings.
